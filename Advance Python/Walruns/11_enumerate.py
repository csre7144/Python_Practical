# Practice 01:

# l = [3,55,130,150]

# index = 0
# for item in l:
#     index += 1
#     print(f"The item number {index} is {item}")

# Output:-
# The item number 1 is 3
# The item number 2 is 55
# The item number 3 is 130
# The item number 4 is 150

# Practice 02:

# This can be simplified using enumerate function
l = [3,55,130,150]

index = 0
for index, item in enumerate(l):
    print(f"The item number {index} is {item}")

# Output:-
# The item number 1 is 3
# The item number 2 is 55
# The item number 3 is 130
# The item number 4 is 150
